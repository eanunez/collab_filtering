# Article Recommender- Neutral Collaborative Filtering

This is an article recommender which is based on collaborative filtering. 
The idea is borrowed from Keras' demo on collaborative filtering 
and modified to fit for article recommender system. 
However, the methods are generic to accept users and items of different header columns.
