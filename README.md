# Article Recommender - Neural Collaborative Filtering

This is an article recommender which is based on collaborative filtering. 
The idea is borrowed from Keras' [demo](https://keras.io/examples/structured_data/collaborative_filtering_movielens/) on collaborative filtering 
and modified to fit for article recommender system, replacing rating with time on page. 
The methods are generic to accept users and items of different header columns.
